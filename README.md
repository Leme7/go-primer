# Cloud Native Go

## Go Primer
This repository contains some very simple Go files that illustrate Go basics. These files are used by the **Go Primer** chapter of **Cloud Native Go**

For the individual Go files in the root directory, execute those with `go run (file)`.

To build the NPCs package, go to the `npcs` directory and type `go build ./...`
